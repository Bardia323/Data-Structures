# ðŸ§® Data Structures
## About the Project 
The aim of this project is to implement a few common and not-so-common data structures for me to use in other projects.
The code isn't the best but it is good enough to help me learn and to use as a reference for myself and others. 
The Data Structures studied and coded are:

* Trees
* Graphs (two versions)
* Queue
* Stack
* Time Machine
* Statistic
